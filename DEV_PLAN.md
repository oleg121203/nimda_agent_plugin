# NIMDA Modernization and Development Plan v3.2
Version: 2.0
Date: 11.07.2025
Technology stack: Python 3.11+, PySide6, Asyncio

The main goal is to create an intelligent, universal and adaptive assistant for IT infrastructure management with an intuitive voice and text interface. Below is a concise summary of the architecture and development roadmap.

## 1. Project Architecture
The project follows an asynchronous modular architecture for flexibility and scalability. PySide6 is used for a dynamic GUI. The main modules include:
- **Core**: orchestration logic and state management
- **Agents**: `chat_agent` for conversations and `worker_agent` for technical tasks
- **Intelligence**: adaptive thinking and learning modules
- **GUI**: main window, chat panel and dynamic display canvas
- **Plugins**: CLI adapters (e.g. MikroTik, Linux, Cisco)
- **Services**: voice, translation and documentation parsing services
- **Configs** and **Data** directories for settings and runtime data

## 2. Agent Interaction Model
Two agents share responsibilities:
- **chat_agent** – interprets user intentions, handles dialogue and quality control
- **worker_agent** – executes structured JSON tasks, manages the GUI and CLI commands

## 3. Intelligent Systems
- **adaptive_thinker.py** – builds reasoning chains to solve complex tasks
- **learning_module.py** – stores successful cases in a vector database for reuse

## 4. Roadmap
1. **Core and GUI skeleton** – project structure, asyncio, basic store, static GUI
2. **Basic request/response flow** – chat_agent and worker_agent communication, simple CLI plugin, translator service
3. **Intelligence layer** – adaptive thinker and learning module with FAISS
4. **Universal adapter and dynamic GUI** – documentation parsing and GUI controller
5. **Services and finalization** – voice service with VAD, hotkeys, testing and packaging
